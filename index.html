<p>Whether you are going through a divorce or involved in another civil case, you need a lawyer who will fight for you. With 30 years of experience, Niner | Garcia offers compassionate legal assistance, while zealously defending your rights and protecting your interests.</p>
<h4>When Divorce Is a War Zone</h4>
<p>Many divorces begin after a violent episode between the parties. If an arrest has been made for domestic violence, that case will start in General Sessions Criminal Court. If an order of protection has been sought, that case will often be filed in the General Sessions Civil Court. In most counties in Tennessee, your divorce will be filed in either Chancery or Circuit Court.</p>
<p>Some lawyers will only represent you in one of your cases and refer you to another lawyer for the rest. Venus Niner has experience as a prosecutor, a public defender, and as a divorce lawyer. She will represent you zealously, aggressively and competently, wherever your case leads.</p>

                <h4>Venus Niner is Your Woman</h4>
                “Got my class C felony diverted after 1 year of probation because of Venus. Amazing lawyer.Also, she genuinely cares about her clients on a personal level. She calls to check on you. And she has the best understanding of the laws that serve to protect our rights out of any lawyer that my family had come across when we searched for one, and we spoke with ALOT of lawyers. PLEASE head my advice when I say that just because a lawyer has commercials and billboards next to the interstate, that does not mean they are a competent lawyer, especially whwn compared to an outstanding lawyer like Venus Niner. She is the most educated, experienced, yet understanding advocate a person can have for themself when they walk into a courtroom. If you need an attorney, Venus Niner is your woman. And if you are worried about price, at least call and set up an appointment to speak with her. You will never know unless you talk to her. Sometimes, it is the rest of your life at stake when you have to go into court. Go face it unprotected. Let Venus protect you.”
